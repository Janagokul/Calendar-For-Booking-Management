<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This will be a basic guide about folder structure and components and how to interate in main project..........

Firstly 2 addition dependency is needed "@mui/x-date-pickers" ,"dayjs" along with complete MUI

starting from app js :- which is connected to index js component like a tipical react app.... only main Calendar component and its Css files are imorted nothing else...


Calendar js:- This is the main starting file ... you have to incluede this file... It has two component for two different screen size ... and it also provide value of the selected Date and time which you can use directly to any other component..... 

According to to different Screen size two component are their in Screens folder which provides responsiveness to a certain extent... you can make it more before integration or in mantain time after website live..... you can improve nice looking color palate  ........


Finaly in component folder ther are 3 component sidebar, MUI DateCalendar and Time component..... I'm tried to give as much comment in coresponding css file....... try to improve customization of different component and color palate...
